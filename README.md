## env_encryption_tool :copyright: Project Goals & Info

**Purpose**: the goal for this project is to encrypt .env files for a given Rust application and store them in an encrypted state, then decrypt them at runtime using an OS-based environment variable and pass them to the application. This requires any potential/illicit attacker to breach the operating system's security and access its environment variables before any application-level environment variables can be compromised. 

**Now uses PQ (Post-Quantum) cryptographic algorithms** :nail_care:

*Disclaimer:* this project is stable and can be used in production environments, but SLA-based support won't be offered until we're at v1.0 and/or sponsored. :bowtie:

## Installation Instructions

1. [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) :earth_americas:
2. Clone/fork the env_encryption_tool repo :zap:
3. Set an OS-level environment variable named "DECRYPTION_KEY" ( :earth_americas: [for Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45502996/how-to-set-environment-variable-in-linux-permanently), :earth_africa: [for Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable), :earth_asia: [for MacOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65597552/how-exactly-to-set-up-and-use-environment-variables-on-a-mac)) to your desired 32-byte/character value :lock:
4. Run "cargo build --release" - this outputs a binary in the target/release folder :sparkles:
5. Run the binary in the same folder as your .env file - this outputs a env.enc file :confetti_ball:
6. Integrate the included decrypt_config.rs file and its crates into your Rust project :star:
7. Copy the env.enc file to the same folder your Rust binary runs in and voila! You have encrypted environment variables provided to your application at runtime. :tada:
